## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **data analysis case study** completed as part of a **Data Analytics Bootcamp**.

The analysis explores how **weather conditions** and **socio-economic factors** relate to **happiness levels** across **50 European countries**.

We combine:
- The **World Happiness Report** dataset (from Kaggle)
- Historical **weather data** collected via the **Meteostat API**

All data is analyzed for the year **2015**.
